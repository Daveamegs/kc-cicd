# AUTOMATING CI/CD PIPELINE WITH GITHUB ACTIONS: DEPLOYING TO MINIKUBE ON AWS EC2 VIA TERRAFORM

## INTRODUCTION
In today's rapidly evolving software development landscape, continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) have become essential practices for delivering reliable, high-quality applications at speed. Leveraging modern tools and platforms, such as GitHub Actions and Terraform, allows developers to automate their deployment pipelines efficiently. This task involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions to automatically deploy code from a GitHub repository to a Minikube cluster running on an EC2 instance, which is provisioned using Terraform. This approach not only streamlines the deployment process but also ensures consistency and scalability in managing infrastructure and application deployments.

## PREREQUISITE
Below are the things you need to have installed and available already.
- Terraform CLI
- AWSCLI
- AWS Account (Configured locally)
- Github Account

Logged in to github and created a repository, called it kc-cicd and cloned the repo locally unto my workspace.

## STEP 2 - ADD APPLICATION CODE

## STEP 3 - CREATE KUBERNETES MANIFESTS

## STEP 4 - CREATE GITHUB ACTIONS WORKFLOWS

## STEP 5 - CREATE TERRAFORM MODULES

## STEP 6 - ACCESS THE MINIKUBE CLUSTER
